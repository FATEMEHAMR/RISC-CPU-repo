# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to design and practically implement the architecture of a simple sample processor. For this purpose, a sample processor with a reduced instruction set (RISC) architecture is considered, with instructions of the type **memory-oriented**. A description of these instructions is provided in the table below.

| **Description** | **Instruction** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Add the operand of instruction to the value of a specific register | Add |
| Arithmetic shifting the operand of instruction to left | Ashl |
| Applying Xnor to the operand of instruction and the value of a specific register | Xnor |
| Divide the operand of instruction by 2 | Division by 2 |
| Load the value of the operand of instruction to a specific register | Load |
| Store the value of a specific register to the operand of instruction | Store |
| Twoâ€™s complement the operand of instruction | CMP |

If we know that the input data to this processor is 8 bits, the full design process for this processor should be carried out and implemented using the hardware description language **Verilog**. To do this, it is necessary to clearly specify the details of the instruction implementation, all required units, and the data paths according to your design, and report them. After the implementation, the functionality of the designed processor must be tested, and all instructions should be provided as input to the implemented system in the format you have designed. The final result and execution process should be displayed.


Assume we want to execute an instruction in the designed processor where the operand of the instruction is rounded up to the nearest power of two, and the result is stored in the same location (for example, input **10** is rounded to **16** and input **5** is rounded to **8**). Define your proposed algorithm to perform this operation approximately using the designed processor (within the framework of the implemented instructions), and after verifying its functionality, input this instruction into the processor you designed. Then, specify the output result and discuss the correctness of the operation. In this section, the performance of the proposed algorithm and its adaptation to the designed processor, along with its implementation, will be evaluated.
